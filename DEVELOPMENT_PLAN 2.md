## Technical Architecture

### State Management
```typescript
Zustand Store (src/store/useStore.ts)
â”œâ”€â”€ Auth State
â”œâ”€â”€ Data Collections (personnel, customers, materials, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ CRUD Actions
â”œâ”€â”€ Business Logic (approvals, station workflows, etc.)
â””â”€â”€ Transaction Logging
```

### Page Structure
```
/login - Authentication
/dashboard
  â”œâ”€â”€ / - Home with stats
  â”œâ”€â”€ /insights - AI insights & charts
  â”œâ”€â”€ /inventory - Material management
  â”œâ”€â”€ /customers - Customer CRUD
  â”œâ”€â”€ /work-orders - Order management
  â”œâ”€â”€ /operators - Performance tracking
  â”œâ”€â”€ /invoices - Billing management
  â”œâ”€â”€ /shipping - Logistics
  â”œâ”€â”€ /transactions - Audit log
  â””â”€â”€ /admin
      â”œâ”€â”€ /personnel - Employee management
      â”œâ”€â”€ /templates - Workflow builder
      â””â”€â”€ /stations - Station monitoring
/station - Operator view (QR login)
```

### Key Libraries
- **ReactFlow**: Flowchart builder for work order templates
- **Recharts**: Interactive charts and analytics
- **jsPDF + html2canvas**: PDF generation for invoices/labels
- **react-qr-code**: QR code generation for operators
- **Zustand**: State management with persistence
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation

## Design System

### Colors
- **Primary (Steel Blue)**: #4682B4
- **Dark (Deep Indigo)**: #111439
- **Neutral (Gray)**: #B0B3B8
- **Accents**: #6FA3D8 (light blue), #2E5A8A (dark blue)

### Components
- Gradient backgrounds for emphasis
- Glass-morphism cards with backdrop blur
- Consistent border styling with white/10 opacity
- Custom scrollbars matching theme
- Responsive grid layouts

## Testing & Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Branches
- **main**: Stable releases
- **mvp**: Working simplified version (deployed to GitHub Pages)
- **full-build**: Complete feature-rich version (in development)

## Next Steps
1. Complete enhanced sample data generation
2. Build flowchart editor for templates
3. Implement operator station view with gamification
4. Add PDF generation for invoices/shipping
5. Complete all admin tools
6. Test end-to-end workflows
7. Merge to main and deploy

## Notes
- All passwords work in demo mode (no actual auth)
- Sample data persists in localStorage
- Transaction log tracks all changes
- Work orders follow template-defined station flows
- Quality checks can send orders back to previous stations
- Operators can only access valid stations for each order
